Because of Vincent's power-hungry nature, he has stolen Phineas Sterling's prized Æther to use in his twisted inventions.\n\nThe retrieval plan was simple. Get in. Get out. Get paid. However, Vincent is more clever than you originally intended. Now you and your renegade team of thieves must outsmart Vincent and his menacing \"Clockwork Corridor.\" Are you up to the task?\n\nSet in an alternate timeline, \"Clockwork Corridor,\" is immersed in Victorian Steampunk culture and sophistication. Retro-futuristic inventions dominate this industrial steam-powered society and the race for power keeps man driven. The science of alchemy, which uses rare chemicals to create elixirs, can empower these mechanized gadgets. This is the root of Vincent Vondæther's distorted success.",
